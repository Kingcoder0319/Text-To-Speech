## Output
# This is the text given to the python code 
Ladies and gentlemen,

Today, I stand before you to talk about one of the most influential and inspiring leaders in the history of India, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

Netaji, as he is lovingly called, was a visionary, a freedom fighter, and a true embodiment of courage and determination. Born on January 23, 1897, his unwavering dedication to the cause of India's independence propelled him to become one of the key figures in our freedom struggle.

Driven by a burning desire to free India from the clutches of British rule, Netaji's leadership and relentless efforts left an indelible mark on our nation's history. He believed in the power of unity and actively worked towards uniting people across different ideologies and backgrounds under the banner of freedom.

Netaji's audacious decision to form the Indian National Army (INA) in collaboration with Japan during World War II showcased his strategic acumen and his unwavering commitment to the cause of independence. He aimed to harness the strength and determination of his fellow countrymen to fight for freedom and liberate India.

His famous words, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," echo the passion and sacrifice he embodied. Netaji's selfless dedication to the nation and his unwavering belief in the rights and dignity of every Indian continue to inspire generations.

Even though his life was tragically cut short, his spirit lives on as an eternal symbol of bravery, resilience, and patriotism. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose remains an icon, a guiding light, and a true inspiration for every Indian who aspires for a better tomorrow.

Let us remember and honor this great leader, whose legacy continues to inspire us to strive for a free, prosperous, and united India.

Thank you.
